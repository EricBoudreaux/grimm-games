                If you're reading this, then that means you already know this part. But I finished it early yesterday before work, and I hate to pat myself on the back, but I'm digging how it turned out. I designed and built off those designs, which feels extra special because it all came out of my brain! Save any compliments for after you read this entire post pls.

            </h4>

                So I honestly haven't touched this project in about four or so months, until yesterday when I had to edit some footage for it. I forgot how, dare I venture to say...polished?..?..it is. 
                It was fun returning to it, and I noticed that it's pretty much ready to be shipped out. Just gotta work out a few very minor bugs and I can upload it to google drive and let you guys play it.
                It's probably about a 15-20 minute playthrough, there's no combat. Just exploring and some minor puzzles. After it's over, you can explore the upcoming areas of the game freely. 

                It's a really big story though, one that I'm excited to tell and so it may take some time to roll some more of this content out unfourtunatly.

            </h4>
            <p className='text-white'>
                This one just needs a few features implemented and it's also pretty ready to be shipped. I would say this one is a bit longer, about 30 - 1 hour of playtime. There is combat and a pretty tight story line.

                Which leads me to my next bit of news...

            <p className='text-white'>
                Like being struck by lightning, I've been burning the candle at both ends developing this one, driven by the excitement I am for it!
                I got a sweet, albeit somewhat limited, graphics package for this project, so it's a new look. If the other games remind you of Super Nintendo, these will remind you of the Gameboy Color. I don't know how else everyone feels about the looks, but it is deeply nostalgic to me and that gives it about a 3.7x boost to my inspiration. 
                You probably want the deats eh?   
            </p>
            <p className='text-white'>
                I am only going to say that it is HEAVILY inspired by Fire Emblem games, with a little more RPG thrown in the mix. Something I've wanted to do for a while mow. More details to come in the future!
            </p>
            <p className='text-white'>
                And that's about it. I'll continue working on all of these. How about I hold myself to account?   
            </p>
            <p className='text-white'>

                And since I don't want to over-saturate the market, I will be releasing the first chapter of Dream Reign...drum roll pls....October 19th!

            <p className='text-white'>
                Why October 19th? I don't know. It had a nice ring to it.
